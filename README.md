# Analysis of player count of Paradox Interactive games.

### The Idea
The goal of this analysis is to see how Paradox's player base change over the years, what games they played the most, how new releases (including main competitors) impacted their player engagment.
All games developed by Paradox Development Studio after 2010 are included (except for Sengoku due to no availible data)
### Games analised:
- Crusader Kings 2
- Crusader Kings 3
- March of the Eagles
- Europa Universalis 4
- Victoria 2
- Victoria 3
- Hearts of Iron 3
- Hearts of Iron 4
- Imperator: Rome
- Cities Skylines 1
- Cities Skylines 2
- Stellaris

### Data Limitations
Data comes exclusivly from steam data (from https://steamcharts.com/), meaning that older titles will have incomplete data (as they were released as non-steam and steam versions) and we won't see activity from consoles.

### Used Technologies:
#### - Python:
- Selenium
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

#### - PowerBI
